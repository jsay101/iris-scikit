# iris-scikit.
This code demonstrates the use of several machine learning techniques in Python using the Scikit-learn and Seaborn libraries.

Usage
To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python environment or Jupyter notebook. Make sure to install the required libraries before running the code.

Libraries
The following libraries are used in this code:

Seaborn
Matplotlib
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Description
The code begins by loading the 'iris' dataset from the Seaborn library and displaying the first few rows. It then proceeds to plot a pair plot and scatter plot using Seaborn.

Next, the code provides an example of supervised learning using simple linear regression. It uses the Scikit-learn library to fit a linear regression model to a set of data, plot the data and the regression line, and display the coefficients of the fitted model.

The code then provides an example of classification using Naive Bayes. It uses the Scikit-learn library to fit a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to the 'iris' dataset and predict the species of a test set. The accuracy score of the model is then displayed.

The code also includes an example of unsupervised learning using clustering. It uses the Scikit-learn library to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the 'iris' dataset and predict the cluster labels. The code then displays a scatter plot of the data with each point colored according to its species and cluster label.
